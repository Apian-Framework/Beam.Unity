I decided it was best to include the source for this plugin as part of this Unity project rather than only referring to it on GitHub (in case it went away.)

Basically I dropped the github repo as-is in this folder and got rid of the .git subfolder so it became part of the containing project repo.

The actual source repo for WebGLThreadingPatcher is: https://github.com/VolodymyrBS/WebGLThreadingPatcher

All credit (and thanks) go to the author.
